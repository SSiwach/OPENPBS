# OPENPBS
OpenPBS software optimizes job scheduling and workload management in high-performance computing (HPC) environments – clusters, clouds, and supercomputers – improving system efficiency and people’s productivity. Built by HPC people for HPC people, OpenPBS is fast, scalable, secure, and resilient, and supports all modern infrastructure, middleware, and applications.

So in this directory I put PBS_Job scripting file for future reference. In our current HPC we are using OPENPBS.
Also we can use SLURM for job_scripting and job managment which is used in PARAM - SHIVAY Supercomputer at IIT-BHU.
