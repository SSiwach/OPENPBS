# OPENPBS
OpenPBS software optimizes job scheduling and workload management in high-performance computing (HPC) environments – clusters, clouds, and supercomputers – improving system efficiency and people’s productivity. Built by HPC people for HPC people, OpenPBS is fast, scalable, secure, and resilient, and supports all modern infrastructure, middleware, and applications.

So in this directory I put PBS_Job scripting file for future reference.
